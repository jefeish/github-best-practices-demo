# GitHub Repository Hygiene Recommendations :sweat_drops:

A document on GitHub recommended Repository Hygiene, what do we considered part of Repo-Hygiene and what should you use to maintain it.

:warning: We purposely don't go too deep in to the 'how' of the Repo-Hygiene, since the implementation can heavily depend on individual company standards.
