# GitHub Repository Hygiene Recommendations :sweat_drops:

The **WHY**, **WHAT**, and **HOW** of Repository Hygiene.

A GitHub recommendation on what should be considered part of Repo-Hygiene, and how to maintain it. 

There are multiple ways to look at Repository Hygiene and we do not claim to have the "one size fits all" solution.
What good Repository hygiene is to you, depends on what your priorities are. What we do in this doc is to point out important (useful) areas that can help you decide how to keep things clean.

>Note:  Good Repo-hygiene does not always guarantee good Repo-health but it does put you on the right track. ðŸ˜·

## WHY ? 

### :bulb: Keep a clean Repository clean = Repo-Hygiene!

Even if your Repository appears to perform well on the GitHub platform and the owners don't currently voice any complaints, it is still crucial to prioritize Repository Hygiene. Here's why:

  - Any Repository that is "clean" today might not be so after the next commit.
  - A clean (healthy) Repository is fundamental for good collaboration!

There are several compelling reasons, beyond platform performance, that highlight the importance of implementing a robust Repository Hygiene process. These reasons can be broadly categorized into three key areas.

  |Security|Protection|Standards|
  |---|---|---|
  |Ensure that no secrets and <br>no vulnerabilities get committed|Enforce collaboration policies|Compliance rules to maintain a clean Repository and<br> ensure good collaboration|

GitHub places great importance on collaboration, a well-organized repository encourages easy participation and contribution, while minimizing the learning curve and potential risks of errors.
 > Note: The task to get a Repository in to a "clean" state is a pre-requirement. The Repository-Hygiene process goal is to maintain a clean environment.

\* How to set it up and how to maintain it for Repo-Hygiene

### Repository Hygiene and Trust-Level

In a GitHub Organization, owners have the same control over a Repository as the Repository owners or adminstrators. Many of the policy features shown here allow for modifications on an adminstrator level.
If you want to enforce Repo-Hygiene standards even for that access level, you would need to use Apps or Actions to control this.
Keep in mind that GitHub WebHook events are reactionary and do not prevent the intial push to a Repository.
The general process is,

  - Detect
  - Report
  - Correct
